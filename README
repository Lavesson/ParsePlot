A parser (and in time, plot data generator) for mathematical expressions. Written in Code::Blocks and should compile under GCC.
Implements Dijkstra's shunting yard algorithm. The current implementation parses the input from a string to RPN. This expression is then calculated and returned to the user.

It's kind of old and crappy though.

Documentation is not pushed, but can be generated through code comments.
Clone the repo and use DoxyGen.

GitHub seems to have played around a little with the code indentation.
