A parser (and in time, plot data generator) for mathematical expressions. Should compile under GCC. The project is basically abandoned for now due more pressing matters such as work and other projects.
Implements Dijkstra's shunting yard algorithm. The current implementation parses the input from a string to RPN. This expression is then calculated and returned to the user.

Documentation is not pushed, but can be generated through code comments. Clone the repo and use DoxyGen.

Status: The parser works. The plotter is basically useless right now since it's only partially implemented
